# GardenPlanner

We have three raised beds. My wife challenged me to help her work out which plants to put in each raised bed. The constraints are:
1) Use as many plants as possible
2) Some plants don't like being close to others and should be planted in different beds
3) Some plants are susceptible to aphid attack, others repel aphids. Susceptible plants should paired in the same bed with repelling plants.
